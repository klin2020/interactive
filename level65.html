            What does the word "dead beef" mean? I read it from a interview question. 
            It has something to do with ipv6. 
            I figured it could be a random hex number used for examples, like "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
            <br> <br>
            Is my understanding correct? Or it has more significant meaning?

            "Dead beef" is a very popular sentence in programming, because it is built only from letters a-f, which are used in hexadecimal notation. 
            Colons in the beginning and in the middle of the sentence make this sentence a (theoretically) valid IPv6 address.

            The value of 0xDEADBEEF has three practical benefits, mostly for older systems. 
            Old assembler/C hacks, like me, would use it to fill unallocated memory to coax out memory issues. 
            Also, it's a pun of the slang term "dead meat". The programmer is dead meat if DEADBEEF winds up in his pointers. 
            I congratulate the guy who first thought of using the value DEADBEEF. It's clever in many ways. <br>
            As for practical reasons, firstly, it's more noticeable in a hex memory dump because it actually spells words as opposed to random hex values.<br>
            Secondly, if the value winds up in a pointer, it's more likely to induce a memory out-of-range fault. 
            An address of DEADBEEF was out of the address range of systems (we're talking last century systems now) regardless of the system's endian.<br>
            Thirdly, it is more likely to induce a fault on systems that require even boundary pointer values for accessing 16/32/64-bit data. 
            The value is more likely to fault because both of the 16 bit values (DEAD, BEEF) are odd.

            It's a made up expression using only the letters A-F, often used when a recognisable hexadecimal number is required. 
            Some systems use it for various purposes such as showing memory which has been freed and should not be referenced again. 
            In a debugger this value showing up could be a sign that you have made an error.  <nobr>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexspeak" style="color: #70a1c2;">Wikipedia</a>:</nobr>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            0xDEADBEEF ("dead beef") is used by IBM RS/6000 systems, Mac OS on 32-bit PowerPC processors and the Commodore Amiga as a magic debug value. 
            On Sun Microsystems' Solaris, it marks freed kernel memory. On OpenVMS running on Alpha processors, DEAD_BEEF can be seen by pressing CTRL-T.
            <br>
            The number 0xDEADBEEF is equal to the less recognisable decimal number 3735928559 (unsigned) or -559038737 (signed).

            Since IPv6-Adresses are written in Hex-notation you can use "Hexspeak" (numbers 0-9 and letters a-f) in Adresses.
            <br>
            There are a number of words you can use as valid adresses to better momorize them.
            <br>
            If you ping6 www.facebook.com -n you will get something like "2a03:2880:f01c:601:face:b00c:0:1".
            <br>
            Here are some examples:
            <ul>
                <li>:affe:: (Affe - German for Monkey - seen at a vlan for management board)</li>
                <li>:1bad:babe:: (one bad babe - seen at a smtp-honeypot)</li>
                <li>:badc:ab1e:: (bad cable - seen as subnet for a unsecure vlan)</li>
                <li>:da7a:: (Data - seen for fileservers)</li>
                <li>:d1a1:: (Dial - seen for VPN Dial-In)</li>
            </ul>

            It is also used for debugging purposes. <br>
            Here is a handy list of some of these values: <br>

            People normally use it to indicate dummy values. I think that it primarily was used before the idea of NULL pointers. <br>

            It's a magic number used in various places because it also happens to be readable in English, making it stand out.

            It was used as a pattern to store in memory as a series of hex bytes (0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xef). 
            You could see if memory was corrupted because of hardware failure, buffer overruns, etc.
