    <p>Packed day today. <br> <br>
        Had Biennale discussion in the morning, 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; then ate lunch w/ Olivia 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  and picked up sketchbooks before heading to Arsenale. 
        <br>
        <br> The artwork was insane. 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;  We saw such a well curated show.
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our prof was able to show us thematic threads throughout each room 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and I have a newfound appreciation for contemporary art. 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm excited to go back and take a closer look at everything.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then we went to Ocean Space's event where we went to a park on the mainland 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; and talked about detecting pollution in clams. 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will never eat clams again, but learned a lot about them!
        <br>
        <br>
        Beautiful sunset, long trip back, and Olivia and I decided to get takeout food 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; & aperol spritzes
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sit by the river to eat dinner. 
        <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was so nice to talk to her about anything. I am very grateful
        to get to know her.
